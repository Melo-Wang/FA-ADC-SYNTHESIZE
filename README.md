# FA-ADC-SYNTHESIZE
This is a 3D convolution U-Net to synthesize MRI FA and ADC phases. It can also work as a generator of condition GAN.

The objective of this project is to synthesize
Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) from the provided T1-weighted (T1w) and
T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Learning-based methods will be utilized to extract
the brain region, align the multichannel images, and pixelwise synthesize the outcomes. Additionally, traditional feature extraction techniques will be employed to facilitate the
progress. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to demonstrate the optimal solution
